## Android V2 Prototype


The 2nd complete (and fully testable) prototype for my fantasy sports game for Android.

I've since completed version 3 for iOS, which works along side NBA games during the 2021 NBA seasson. 

## IOS V3 Available

Darkhorse V3 is available for iPhone through TestFlight, which is Apple's beta testing software.

To install TestFlight on an iPhone, go to https://testflight.apple.com/join/VvpAAjmW. Once installed, open TestFlight (or return to the download link again) to install Darkhorse.

I've decided to keep the full Xcode/Swift repo private, but you can verfity that I developed it by looking through my StackOverflow history, and questions like this one https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42876739/swift-increment-label-with-stepper-in-tableview-cell 

IOS V.3 features real time contests with up to the minute scoring.
